The Student Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows users (typically school/college administrators) to manage and maintain student records efficiently. The system provides functionalities such as adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting student data. It uses basic arrays and procedural programming techniques to handle operations, making it a great beginner-level project for understanding core C++ concepts like arrays, loops, functions, and conditionals.

🔧 Technologies Used:
Programming Language: C++

Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler (Code::Blocks, Dev C++, g++, etc.)

Environment: Console/Terminal

📚 Features:

1. ➕ Add Student Record

Allows the user to input and store multiple student records.

Details include: Name, Roll Number, Course, and Age.

Checks if it's the first time adding or adding more students to an existing list.

2. 👁️ View All Student Records

Displays all the student data currently stored.

Outputs data in a clean, readable format.

3. 🔍 Search Student by Roll Number

User can search for a specific student using their roll number.

If found, it displays the complete details of that student.

4. ✏️ Update Student Record

Allows modification of an existing student's data using their roll number.

Displays the previous data and takes new values from the user.

5. ❌ Delete Student Record

Option to either:

Delete all student records at once.

Delete a specific student’s record by entering their roll number.

Deleting a specific student involves shifting array values to remove the record cleanly.

6. 🚪 Exit the System

Ends the program execution gracefully.

🧠 Concepts Practiced:

Use of arrays to store structured data.

Loops (for, while) for handling repeated operations.

Conditional statements (if, else, switch) for logic flow.

Functions to separate concerns (add, show, search, update, delete).

System commands like system("pause") for execution control.

Simple implementation of record management logic manually without using file systems or databases.

✅ Advantages of this Project:

Helps beginners get hands-on practice with real-world logic in C++.

Provides a good understanding of how basic CRUD operations work.

Great foundation for transitioning to file-based or database-driven applications.
